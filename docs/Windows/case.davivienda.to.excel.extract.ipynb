Benchmark for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 \\n(non-R2) Benchmark. CIS encourages you to migrate to a more recent, supported \\nversion of this technology. \\nAll CIS Benchmarks focus on technical configuration settings used to maintain and/or \\nincrease the security of the addressed technology, and they should be used in \\nconjunction with other essential cyber hygiene tasks like: \\n• Monitoring the base operating system for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with \\nthe latest security patches  \\n• Monitoring applications and libraries for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with \\nthe latest security patches \\nIn the end, the CIS Benchmarks are designed as a key component of a comprehensive \\ncybersecurity program.  \\nThis document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration \\nposture for Microsoft Windows. \\nThis secure configuration guide is based on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and is \\nintended for all versions of the Server 2008 operating system, including older versions. \\nThis secure configuration guide was tested against Microsoft Windows Server 2008 \\nDatacenter. \\nTo ensure all new and updated group policy objects (GPOs) are installed on the system, \\nplease download the newest version of the ADMX/ADML templates for Windows 11. \\nTemplates can be downloaded from Microsoft at: Download ADMX Templates for \\nWindows 11 October 2021 Update [21H2] from Official Microsoft Download Center. \\nTo obtain the latest version of this secure configuration guide, please visit \\nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/. If you have questions, comments, or have \\nidentified ways to improve this guide, please write us at feedback@cisecurity.org. \\n \\nIntended Audience \\nThe Windows CIS Benchmarks are written for Active Directory domain-joined systems \\nusing Group Policy, not standalone/workgroup systems. Adjustments/tailoring to some \\nrecommendations will be needed to maintain functionality if attempting to implement \\nCIS hardening on standalone systems or a system running in the cloud. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 21 \\nConsensus Guidance \\nThis CIS Benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of a \\nglobal community of subject matter experts. The process combines real world \\nexperience with data-based information to create technology specific guidance to assist \\nusers to secure their environments. Consensus participants provide perspective from a \\ndiverse set of backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and \\ncompliance, security research, operations, government, and legal.  \\nEach CIS Benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase \\noccurs during initial Benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts \\nconvene to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the Benchmark. This discussion \\noccurs until consensus has been reached on Benchmark recommendations. The \\nsecond phase begins after the Benchmark has been published. During this phase, all \\nfeedback provided by the Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for \\nincorporation in the Benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus \\nprocess, please visit https://workbench.cisecurity.org/. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 22 \\nTypographical Conventions \\nThe following typographical conventions are used throughout this guide: \\nConvention \\nMeaning \\nStylized Monospace font \\nUsed for blocks of code, command, and script \\nexamples.

If any of the components are not applicable it will be noted or the \\ncomponent will not be included in the recommendation.    \\nTitle \\nConcise description for the recommendation\\'s intended configuration.  \\nAssessment Status \\nAn assessment status is included for every recommendation. The assessment status \\nindicates whether the given recommendation can be automated or requires manual \\nsteps to implement. Both statuses are equally important and are determined and \\nsupported as defined below:  \\nAutomated \\nRepresents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control can be fully \\nautomated and validated to a pass/fail state. Recommendations will include the \\nnecessary information to implement automation. \\nManual \\nRepresents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control cannot be \\nfully automated and requires all or some manual steps to validate that the configured \\nstate is set as expected. The expected state can vary depending on the environment. \\nProfile \\nA collection of recommendations for securing a technology or a supporting platform. \\nMost benchmarks include at least a Level 1 and Level 2 Profile. Level 2 extends Level 1 \\nrecommendations and is not a standalone profile. The Profile Definitions section in the \\nbenchmark provides the definitions as they pertain to the recommendations included for \\nthe technology.  \\nDescription \\nDetailed information pertaining to the setting with which the recommendation is \\nconcerned. In some cases, the description will include the recommended value. \\nRationale Statement \\nDetailed reasoning for the recommendation to provide the user a clear and concise \\nunderstanding on the importance of the recommendation. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 24 \\nImpact Statement  \\nAny security, functionality, or operational consequences that can result from following \\nthe recommendation. \\nAudit Procedure  \\nSystematic instructions for determining if the target system complies with the \\nrecommendation  \\nRemediation Procedure \\nSystematic instructions for applying recommendations to the target system to bring it \\ninto compliance according to the recommendation. \\nDefault Value \\nDefault value for the given setting in this recommendation, if known. If not known, either \\nnot configured or not defined will be applied.  \\nReferences \\nAdditional documentation relative to the recommendation.  \\nCIS Critical Security Controls® (CIS Controls®) \\nThe mapping between a recommendation and the CIS Controls is organized by CIS \\nControls version, Safeguard, and Implementation Group (IG). The Benchmark in its \\nentirety addresses the CIS Controls safeguards of (v7) “5.1 - Establish Secure \\nConfigurations” and (v8) \\'4.1 - Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process” \\nso individual recommendations will not be mapped to these safeguards. \\nAdditional Information  \\nSupplementary information that does not correspond to any other field but may be \\nuseful to the user.  \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 25 \\nProfile Definitions  \\nThe following configuration profiles are defined by this Benchmark: \\n• \\nLevel 1 - Domain Controller \\nItems in this profile apply to Domain Controllers and intend to: \\no be practical and prudent; \\no provide a clear security benefit; and \\no not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means. \\n• \\nLevel 1 - Member Server \\nItems in this profile apply to Member Servers and intend to: \\no be practical and prudent; \\no provide a clear security benefit; and \\no not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means. \\nItems in this profile also apply to Member Servers that have the following Roles \\nenabled: \\no AD Certificate Services \\no DHCP Server \\no DNS Server \\no File Server \\no Hyper-V \\no Network Policy and Access Services \\no Print Server \\no Remote Access Services \\no Remote Desktop Services \\no Web Server \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 26 \\n• \\nLevel 2 - Domain Controller \\nThis profile extends the \"Level 1 - Domain Controller\" profile.

The value for \\nthis policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand-\\nalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 \\npasswords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum \\npassword age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s). \\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \\nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \\ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nNote #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum \\nlimit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password \\nhistory (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs \\nRationale: \\nThe longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can \\ndetermine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have \\nbeen compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left \\nunchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if \\nusers continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good \\npassword policy is greatly reduced. \\nIf you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same \\nsmall number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum \\npassword age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can \\nreuse their original password. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 30 \\nImpact: \\nThe major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every \\ntime they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their \\npasswords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their \\npasswords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may \\ncreate passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, \\nand so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an \\nexcessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase \\nadministrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help \\ndesk to reset them frequently. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed. \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 24 or \\nmore password(s): \\nComputer Configuration\\\\Policies\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account \\nPolicies\\\\Password Policy\\\\Enforce password history \\nDefault Value: \\n24 passwords remembered on domain members. 0 passwords remembered on stand-\\nalone servers. \\nReferences: \\n1. https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide/ \\nCIS Controls: \\nControls \\nVersion \\nControl \\nIG 1 IG 2 IG 3 \\nv8 \\n5.2 Use Unique Passwords \\n \\nUse unique passwords for all enterprise assets.

If you set the value to 0, the \\npassword will never expire. \\nBecause attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password \\nthe less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this \\nvalue is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to \\nusers having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0. \\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \\nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \\ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nRationale: \\nThe longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a \\nbrute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the \\nuser sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that \\nusers are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because \\nthat allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the \\nvalid user has authorized access. \\nImpact: \\nIf the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their \\npasswords very often.

To address password reuse a combination of \\nsecurity settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history \\nsetting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the \\nEnforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 \\npasswords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the \\npassword they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age \\nsetting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a \\nnumber that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective. \\nImpact: \\nIf an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the \\npassword when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must \\nchange password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the \\npassword until the next day. \\n \\n \\nPage 34 \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed. \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 1 or \\nmore day(s): \\nComputer Configuration\\\\Policies\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account \\nPolicies\\\\Password Policy\\\\Minimum password age \\nDefault Value: \\n1 day on domain members. 0 days on stand-alone servers. \\nReferences: \\n1. https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide/ \\nCIS Controls: \\nControls \\nVersion \\nControl \\nIG 1 IG 2 IG 3 \\nv8 \\n5.2 Use Unique Passwords \\n \\nUse unique passwords for all enterprise assets.

There are many different theories about how to determine the best \\npassword length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \\n\"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and \\ncan include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a \\nvalid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string \\nof random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated \\nabout the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to \\npassword length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password \\nlength setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your \\norganization\\'s business requirements. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s). \\nNote: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the \\nLocal Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy \\nManagement Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. \\nHowever, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to \\na 20 character minimum password length. \\nNote #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \\nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \\ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nRationale: \\nTypes of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common \\nwords and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of \\ncharacters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can \\nuse tools to discover the accounts and passwords. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 36 \\nImpact: \\nRequirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an \\norganization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose \\nit. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account \\nlockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with \\nforgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your \\nusers about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger \\nnumber of character combinations, much harder to discover. \\nNote: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not \\nsupport passwords that are longer than 14 characters.

This fifth category can be regionally specific. \\nEach additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For \\ninstance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 \\n(approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per \\nsecond (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes \\nto crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 \\ncombinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without \\npunctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) \\npossible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 \\nattempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. \\nRemember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT \\ncharacters and other special keyboard characters such as \"!\" or \"@\". Proper use of the \\npassword settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 39 \\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nRationale: \\nPasswords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover \\nwith several publicly available tools. \\nImpact: \\nIf the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls \\nfor locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to \\npasswords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to \\ncomply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. \\nIf your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom \\nversion of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength \\nrules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row \\ncharacters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT \\nkey and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also \\nperform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain \\ncommon dictionary words or fragments. \\nAlso, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of \\na password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy \\nusers and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider \\na requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 \\nrange. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric \\ncharacters that would not add additional complexity to the password.) \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 40 \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to \\nEnabled: \\nComputer Configuration\\\\Policies\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account \\nPolicies\\\\Password Policy\\\\Password must meet complexity requirements \\nDefault Value: \\nEnabled on domain members.

A user who has been assigned this \\nright can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the \\nCreate Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active \\nDirectory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of \\nwhether or not they have been assigned the Add workstations to domain user right. \\nIn Windows-based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or \\ncomputer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to \\nresources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security \\nprincipal with the ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some \\norganizations may want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory \\nenvironment so that they can consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If \\nusers are allowed to add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts \\nwould be hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to trace \\nbecause of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain computers. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Administrators. \\nRationale: \\nThe Add workstations to domain user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users \\nwith this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that \\nviolates organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want \\nits users to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could (re-)install \\nWindows on his or her computer and then add the computer to the domain.

Users who are assigned this \\nuser right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer\\'s time setting is \\nchanged, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events \\noccurred. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE. \\nNote: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain \\nControllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication \\nprotocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain \\nauthorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will \\noccur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not \\nsynchronized with the Domain Controllers. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 72 \\nRationale: \\nUsers who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For \\nexample, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on \\nfiles and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that \\nbelong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log \\non to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol \\nrequires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an \\nadministrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer\\'s time may \\ncause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. \\nThe risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member \\nServers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically \\nsynchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways: \\n• \\nAll client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain \\nController as their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nAll Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller \\n(PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nAll PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the \\nselection of their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nThe PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for \\nthe organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer \\nto synchronize with a reliable external time server. \\nThis vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the \\nsystem time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize \\nwith a time server that is not accurate. \\nImpact: \\nThere should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should \\nbe fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain.

In Windows Vista, \\nexisting NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by \\nreferring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a \\npointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a \\nfile, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a \\nsymbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other \\nprograms and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, \\nthe concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system. \\nSymbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not \\ndesigned to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should \\nonly be assigned to trusted users.

Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and \\nother private security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug \\nprograms user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk \\nfrom this vulnerability. \\nImpact: \\nIf you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical \\ncircumstances rarely require this capability on production computers. If a problem arises \\nthat requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the \\nserver to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a \\nseparate Group Policy for that OU. \\nThe service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs \\nuser right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail. \\nTools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not \\nowned by the person who runs the tools.

When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is \\nalways enabled, regardless of how this setting is configured. Note that this setting will \\nhave no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group \\npolicy because Domain Controllers have no local account database. It can be \\nconfigured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password \\npolicy settings. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. \\nRationale: \\nIn some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a \\nregular schedule for periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may \\nwant to disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password \\nchanges to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it \\ncannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a \\nprime target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account \\nhas a well-known security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow \\nauthentication by using the SID rather than the account name. This capability means \\nthat even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute \\nforce attack by using the SID to log on. \\nImpact: \\nMaintenance issues can arise under certain circumstances if you disable the \\nAdministrator account. For example, if the secure channel between a member computer \\nand the Domain Controller fails in a domain environment for any reason and there is no \\nother local Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix the problem that \\nbroke the secure channel. \\nIf the current Administrator password does not meet the password requirements, you \\nwill not be able to re-enable the Administrator account after it is disabled.

It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account \\nlockout and password policy settings. \\nRationale: \\nThe default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest \\nwith no password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are \\naccessible to the Guest account over the network. This capability means that any \\nnetwork shares with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests \\ngroup, or the Everyone group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to \\nthe exposure or corruption of data. \\nImpact: \\nAll network users will need to authenticate before they can access shared resources.

It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria \\n(TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from \\noccurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this \\nrequirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system \\nexperiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down \\nif a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. \\nIf the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is \\nenabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be \\nsignificant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to \\nDo not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation \\nthreat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a \\ndenial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it \\nis overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the \\nSecurity log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable \\ndamage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS \\nfile system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it \\ncannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form \\nwhen the computer restarts. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. \\nRationale: \\nIf the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or \\nimportant troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security \\nincident.

To change the account, open System Tools, click \\nScheduled Tasks, and then click Accessories folder. Then click AT Service Account on \\nthe Advanced menu. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. \\nRationale: \\nIf you enable this policy setting, jobs that are created by server operators by means of \\nthe AT service will execute in the context of the account that runs that service.

If not, they will fail to \\nauthenticate once the above Require signing value is configured on the Domain \\nControllers. Fortunately, Negotiate signing is the default in the client configuration. \\nNote #2: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind \\n(ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No \\nMicrosoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP \\nsimple bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller. \\nNote #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients \\n(including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active \\nDirectory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those \\napplications. Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure \\nLDAP (LDAPS), or IPsec-protected connections. For more information on how to \\nidentify whether your DCs are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those \\naccesses are coming from), see this Microsoft TechNet blog article: Identifying Clear \\nText LDAP binds to your DC’s – Practical Windows Security \\nRationale: \\nUnsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an \\nintruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then \\nforwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could \\ncause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP \\ndirectory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization\\'s network, you can \\nimplement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, \\nyou could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode \\n(AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all \\ntypes of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult. \\nAdditionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be \\nreceived over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception \\nof account passwords by other systems on the network. \\n \\n \\nPage 152 \\nImpact: \\nUnless TLS/SSL is being used, the LDAP data signing option must be negotiated. \\nClients that do not support LDAP signing will be unable to run LDAP queries against the \\nDomain Controllers.

Alternatively, these clients must have a registry \\nchange. For information about this registry change, see Microsoft Knowledge Base \\narticle 325465: Windows 2000 domain controllers require SP3 or later when using \\nWindows Server 2003 administration tools.

Logon information for domain accounts can be cached \\nlocally to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted. This \\npolicy setting determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is \\ncached locally. If this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker \\nwho is able to access the file system of the server could locate this cached information \\nand use a brute force attack to determine user passwords. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s). \\nRationale: \\nThe number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose \\nlogon information the computer will cache locally. If the number is set to 4, then the \\ncomputer caches logon information for 4 users. When a 5th user logs on to the \\ncomputer, the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session. \\nUsers who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that \\ncomputer. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could \\nlocate this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user \\npasswords.

Configuring this setting to \\nForce Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to \\nthe benchmark. \\nRationale: \\nUsers sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, \\nallowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are \\nused for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is \\nremoved to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using \\nthose credentials. \\nImpact: \\nIf you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is \\nremoved, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still \\nmaintain a protected session. \\nIf you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is \\nremoved. \\nIf you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart \\ncard disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert \\nthe smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped \\ncomputer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function \\nidentically to Lock Workstation. \\nEnforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple \\ncomputers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. \\nFor example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log \\ninto several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network \\nenforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time.

For more information about these \\nsettings, see the \"Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications \\n(four related settings)\" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\nRationale: \\nSession hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network \\nas the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can \\npotentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and \\nforward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the \\nattacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain \\nunauthorized access to data. \\nSMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating \\nsystems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures \\nauthenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the \\nauthentication process, data transmission will not take place. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 187 \\nImpact: \\nThe Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server \\nunless that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing. \\nThe Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, \\nWindows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print \\nsharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking \\nattacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. \\nSMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, \\nwhich is then verified by both the client and the server. \\nImplementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each \\npacket needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is \\nperforming multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain \\nController, file server, print server, and application server performance may be \\nsubstantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned \\nSMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to \\nconnect.

LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user \\nsecurity features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the \\nKerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos \\nprotocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or \\nNTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 \\n(NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients \\nwhen they perform the following operations: \\n• \\nJoin a domain \\n• \\nAuthenticate between Active Directory forests \\n• \\nAuthenticate to down-level domains \\n• \\nAuthenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, \\nor Windows XP \\n• \\nAuthenticate to computers that are not in the domain \\nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which \\nchallenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice \\naffects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security \\nnegotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & \\nNTLM. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 234 \\nRationale: \\nWindows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and \\nNTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients \\nonly send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server \\n2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. \\nHowever, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - \\nwere sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that \\ntraffic to more easily reproduce the user\\'s password. \\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the \\nKerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server \\n2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM \\nprotocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication \\nprotocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the \\nlogon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. \\nEven if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and \\nservers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to \\nauthenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these \\nreasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as \\npossible. \\nImpact: \\nClients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server \\nsupports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 \\nauthentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to \\nauthenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed.

However, the kernel supports case \\nsensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for \\nUNIX (POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will \\nsupport case sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a \\nuser of the POSIX subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by \\nusing mixed case to label it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another \\nuser who uses typical Win32 tools, because only one of the files will be available. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\nRationale: \\nBecause Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case \\nsensitivity, failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that \\nsubsystem to create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of \\nupper and lower case letters.

An attack vector for these programs \\nwas to discover the password of the account named \"Administrator\" because that user \\naccount was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows \\nVista and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a \\ndefault installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the \\ncomputer are initially set up in one of two ways: \\n• \\nIf the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has \\nthe equivalent permissions as a local administrator. \\n• \\nIf the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are \\ncreated. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer \\nand create one if a local administrator account is warranted. \\nOnce Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, \\nbut we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled. \\nImpact: \\nThe built-in Administrator account uses Admin Approval Mode.

More information on this setting \\nis available at: MSKB 4034879: Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry entry to \\nmake LDAP authentication over SSL-TLS more secure \\nNote #2: In March 2020, Microsoft added a new GPO setting named Domain controller: \\nLDAP server channel binding token requirements which was bundled with that month’s \\nWindows security patches. This new “native” setting configures the exact same \\nLdapEnforceChannelBinding registry value and does not depend on an ADMX template. \\nTherefore it should be considered a “superseding” method of achieving the same \\nresults. However, since Extended Support ended on January 14, 2020 for Windows \\nServer 2008 (non-R2) and Windows Server 2008 R2, and they are no longer receiving \\nsecurity patches (unless hosted on Azure or under a paid support contract), they \\ntypically do not have the March 2020 (or later) patch readily available. If this is the case \\nin your environment, this ADMX-based setting should be used with those OSes instead \\nof the new native setting. \\nRationale: \\nRequiring Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) can prevent an attacker who is able to \\ncapture users\\' authentication credentials (e.g. OAuth tokens, session identifiers, etc.) \\nfrom reusing those credentials in another TLS session. This also helps to increase \\nprotection against \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks using LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS \\n(LDAPS). \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 426 \\nImpact: \\nAll LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). \\nThe LDAP server (Domain Controller) rejects authentication requests from clients that \\ndo not do so.

DNS over \\nHTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) \\nresolution over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).

Spoofing makes a \\ntransmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. \\nIt can also help prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because the session in-\\nbetween is encrypted. \\nImpact: \\nIf the option Enabled: Require DoH is chosen, this could limit 3rd party products from \\nlogging DNS traffic (in transit) as the traffic would be encrypted while in transit. The \\nRequire DoH option could also lead to domain-joined systems not functioning properly \\nwithin the environment. \\nThe option Enabled: Allow DoH will perform DoH queries if the configured DNS servers \\nsupport it. If they don´t support it, classic name resolution will be used.

LLMNR does not \\nrequire a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in \\nscenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\nRationale: \\nAn attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS \\n(UDP/137) broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows \\nthe location of the requested system. \\nNote: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting, \\nthe properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP \\n(on the WINS tab in the NIC properties).

IPv6 allows for \\nmany more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and \\noperating systems may not support IPv6 natively. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255) \\nRationale: \\nSince the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize \\nIPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 \\ncomponents removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic \\non. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not \\nneeded. \\nImpact: \\nConnectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that \\ndepends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use \\nIPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail. \\nThis registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How \\nto disable IPv6 or its components in Windows. \\nNote: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the Registry path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set \\nas prescribed. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 479 \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff \\n(255) (DWORD): \\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\TCPIP6\\\\Parameters:Disabl\\nedComponents \\nNote: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted. \\nNote #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this \\nregistry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is \\nprovided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration.

To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the \\nretention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. \\nThe consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the \\nlogs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate \\na large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These \\nrisks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log \\ndata. \\nIdeally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft \\nSystem Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. \\nSuch a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully \\ncompromises a server could clear the Security log.

If TLS is not \\nsupported, the connection fails. \\nNote: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections.

The opposite is true (and is consistent \\nwith the title of the setting). This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative \\nTemplate. \\nRationale: \\nAny feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network \\nconnections are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on \\ntrusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec. \\nImpact: \\nNew Remote Shell connections are not allowed and are rejected by the server. \\nNote: On Server 2012 (non-R2) and newer, due to design changes in the OS after \\nServer 2008 R2, configuring this setting as prescribed will prevent the ability to add or \\nremove Roles and Features (even locally) via the GUI.

on the system. \\nNote: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration \\nfolders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders. \\nCaution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting \\ngrants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and \\nfolders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be \\nsecure. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. \\nRationale: \\nUsers with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer \\ninstallation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in \\nAdministrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators \\ngroup, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities. \\nImpact: \\nNone - this is the default behavior. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed.

(Windows Installer will apply the current user\\'s permissions when it installs \\nprograms that a system administrator does not distribute or offer. This will prevent \\nstandard users from installing applications that affect system-wide configuration items.) \\nCIS Controls: \\nControls \\nVersion \\nControl \\nIG 1 IG 2 IG 3 \\nv8 \\n5.4 Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated \\nAdministrator Accounts \\n \\nRestrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on \\nenterprise assets.

       "'This is the final release of the CIS Benchmark for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 \\n(non-R2) Benchmark. CIS encourages you to migrate to a more recent, supported \\nversion of this technology. \\nAll CIS Benchmarks focus on technical configuration settings used to maintain and/or \\nincrease the security of the addressed technology, and they should be used in \\nconjunction with other essential cyber hygiene tasks like: \\n• Monitoring the base operating system for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with \\nthe latest security patches  \\n• Monitoring applications and libraries for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with \\nthe latest security patches \\nIn the end, the CIS Benchmarks are designed as a key component of a comprehensive \\ncybersecurity program.  \\nThis document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration \\nposture for Microsoft Windows. \\nThis secure configuration guide is based on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and is \\nintended for all versions of the Server 2008 operating system, including older versions. \\nThis secure configuration guide was tested against Microsoft Windows Server 2008 \\nDatacenter. \\nTo ensure all new and updated group policy objects (GPOs) are installed on the system, \\nplease download the newest version of the ADMX/ADML templates for Windows 11. \\nTemplates can be downloaded from Microsoft at: Download ADMX Templates for \\nWindows 11 October 2021 Update [21H2] from Official Microsoft Download Center. \\nTo obtain the latest version of this secure configuration guide, please visit \\nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/. If you have questions, comments, or have \\nidentified ways to improve this guide, please write us at feedback@cisecurity.org. \\n \\nIntended Audience \\nThe Windows CIS Benchmarks are written for Active Directory domain-joined systems \\nusing Group Policy, not standalone/workgroup systems. Adjustments/tailoring to some \\nrecommendations will be needed to maintain functionality if attempting to implement \\nCIS hardening on standalone systems or a system running in the cloud. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 21 \\nConsensus Guidance \\nThis CIS Benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of a \\nglobal community of subject matter experts. The process combines real world \\nexperience with data-based information to create technology specific guidance to assist \\nusers to secure their environments. Consensus participants provide perspective from a \\ndiverse set of backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and \\ncompliance, security research, operations, government, and legal.  \\nEach CIS Benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase \\noccurs during initial Benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts \\nconvene to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the Benchmark. This discussion \\noccurs until consensus has been reached on Benchmark recommendations. The \\nsecond phase begins after the Benchmark has been published. During this phase, all \\nfeedback provided by the Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for \\nincorporation in the Benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus \\nprocess, please visit https://workbench.cisecurity.org/. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 22 \\nTypographical Conventions \\nThe following typographical conventions are used throughout this guide: \\nConvention \\nMeaning \\nStylized Monospace font \\nUsed for blocks of code, command, and script \\nexamples.

The value for \\nthis policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand-\\nalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 \\npasswords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum \\npassword age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s). \\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \\nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \\ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nNote #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum \\nlimit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password \\nhistory (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs \\nRationale: \\nThe longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can \\ndetermine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have \\nbeen compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left \\nunchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if \\nusers continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good \\npassword policy is greatly reduced. \\nIf you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same \\nsmall number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum \\npassword age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can \\nreuse their original password. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 30 \\nImpact: \\nThe major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every \\ntime they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their \\npasswords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their \\npasswords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may \\ncreate passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, \\nand so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an \\nexcessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase \\nadministrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help \\ndesk to reset them frequently. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed. \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 24 or \\nmore password(s): \\nComputer Configuration\\\\Policies\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account \\nPolicies\\\\Password Policy\\\\Enforce password history \\nDefault Value: \\n24 passwords remembered on domain members. 0 passwords remembered on stand-\\nalone servers. \\nReferences: \\n1. https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide/ \\nCIS Controls: \\nControls \\nVersion \\nControl \\nIG 1 IG 2 IG 3 \\nv8 \\n5.2 Use Unique Passwords \\n \\nUse unique passwords for all enterprise assets. Best practice implementation \\nincludes, at a minimum, an 8-character password for accounts using MFA and a \\n14-character password for accounts not using MFA.  \\n● \\n● \\n● \\nv7 \\n16.2 Configure Centralized Point of Authentication \\n \\nConfigure access for all accounts through as few centralized points of \\nauthentication as possible, including network, security, and cloud systems. \\n \\n● \\n● \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 31 \\n1.1.2 (L1) Ensure \\'Maximum password age\\' is set to \\'365 or fewer \\ndays, but not 0\\' (Automated) \\nProfile Applicability: \\n•  Level 1 - Domain Controller \\n•  Level 1 - Member Server \\nDescription: \\nThis policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. \\nValues for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the \\npassword will never expire. \\nBecause attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password \\nthe less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this \\nvalue is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to \\nusers having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0. \\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \\nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \\ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nRationale: \\nThe longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a \\nbrute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the \\nuser sharing the password.

To address password reuse a combination of \\nsecurity settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history \\nsetting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords.

There are many different theories about how to determine the best \\npassword length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \\n\"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and \\ncan include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a \\nvalid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string \\nof random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated \\nabout the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to \\npassword length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password \\nlength setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your \\norganization\\'s business requirements. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s). \\nNote: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the \\nLocal Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy \\nManagement Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. \\nHowever, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to \\na 20 character minimum password length. \\nNote #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \\nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \\ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nRationale: \\nTypes of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common \\nwords and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of \\ncharacters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can \\nuse tools to discover the accounts and passwords. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 36 \\nImpact: \\nRequirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an \\norganization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose \\nit. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account \\nlockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with \\nforgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your \\nusers about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger \\nnumber of character combinations, much harder to discover. \\nNote: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not \\nsupport passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older \\noperating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use \\naccounts that require long passwords. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed. \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 14 or \\nmore character(s): \\nComputer Configuration\\\\Policies\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account \\nPolicies\\\\Password Policy\\\\Minimum password length \\nDefault Value: \\n7 characters on domain members. 0 characters on stand-alone servers. \\nReferences: \\n1. https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide/ \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 37 \\nCIS Controls: \\nControls \\nVersion \\nControl \\nIG 1 IG 2 IG 3 \\nv8 \\n5.2 Use Unique Passwords \\n \\nUse unique passwords for all enterprise assets.

This fifth category can be regionally specific. \\nEach additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For \\ninstance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 \\n(approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per \\nsecond (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes \\nto crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 \\ncombinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without \\npunctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) \\npossible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 \\nattempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. \\nRemember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT \\ncharacters and other special keyboard characters such as \"!\" or \"@\". Proper use of the \\npassword settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 39 \\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nRationale: \\nPasswords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover \\nwith several publicly available tools. \\nImpact: \\nIf the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls \\nfor locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to \\npasswords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to \\ncomply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. \\nIf your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom \\nversion of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength \\nrules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row \\ncharacters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT \\nkey and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also \\nperform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain \\ncommon dictionary words or fragments. \\nAlso, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of \\na password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy \\nusers and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider \\na requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 \\nrange. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric \\ncharacters that would not add additional complexity to the password.) \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 40 \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to \\nEnabled: \\nComputer Configuration\\\\Policies\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account \\nPolicies\\\\Password Policy\\\\Password must meet complexity requirements \\nDefault Value: \\nEnabled on domain members.

A user who has been assigned this \\nright can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the \\nCreate Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active \\nDirectory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of \\nwhether or not they have been assigned the Add workstations to domain user right. \\nIn Windows-based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or \\ncomputer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to \\nresources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security \\nprincipal with the ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some \\norganizations may want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory \\nenvironment so that they can consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If \\nusers are allowed to add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts \\nwould be hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to trace \\nbecause of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain computers. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Administrators. \\nRationale: \\nThe Add workstations to domain user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users \\nwith this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that \\nviolates organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want \\nits users to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could (re-)install \\nWindows on his or her computer and then add the computer to the domain.

Users who are assigned this \\nuser right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer\\'s time setting is \\nchanged, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events \\noccurred. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE. \\nNote: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain \\nControllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication \\nprotocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain \\nauthorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will \\noccur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not \\nsynchronized with the Domain Controllers. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 72 \\nRationale: \\nUsers who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For \\nexample, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on \\nfiles and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that \\nbelong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log \\non to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol \\nrequires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an \\nadministrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer\\'s time may \\ncause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. \\nThe risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member \\nServers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically \\nsynchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways: \\n• \\nAll client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain \\nController as their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nAll Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller \\n(PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nAll PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the \\nselection of their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nThe PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for \\nthe organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer \\nto synchronize with a reliable external time server. \\nThis vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the \\nsystem time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize \\nwith a time server that is not accurate. \\nImpact: \\nThere should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should \\nbe fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain.

In Windows Vista, \\nexisting NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by \\nreferring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a \\npointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a \\nfile, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a \\nsymbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other \\nprograms and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, \\nthe concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system. \\nSymbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not \\ndesigned to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should \\nonly be assigned to trusted users.

Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and \\nother private security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug \\nprograms user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk \\nfrom this vulnerability. \\nImpact: \\nIf you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical \\ncircumstances rarely require this capability on production computers. If a problem arises \\nthat requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the \\nserver to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a \\nseparate Group Policy for that OU. \\nThe service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs \\nuser right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail. \\nTools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not \\nowned by the person who runs the tools.

When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is \\nalways enabled, regardless of how this setting is configured. Note that this setting will \\nhave no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group \\npolicy because Domain Controllers have no local account database. It can be \\nconfigured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password \\npolicy settings. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. \\nRationale: \\nIn some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a \\nregular schedule for periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may \\nwant to disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password \\nchanges to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it \\ncannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a \\nprime target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account \\nhas a well-known security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow \\nauthentication by using the SID rather than the account name. This capability means \\nthat even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute \\nforce attack by using the SID to log on. \\nImpact: \\nMaintenance issues can arise under certain circumstances if you disable the \\nAdministrator account. For example, if the secure channel between a member computer \\nand the Domain Controller fails in a domain environment for any reason and there is no \\nother local Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix the problem that \\nbroke the secure channel. \\nIf the current Administrator password does not meet the password requirements, you \\nwill not be able to re-enable the Administrator account after it is disabled.

It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account \\nlockout and password policy settings. \\nRationale: \\nThe default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest \\nwith no password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are \\naccessible to the Guest account over the network. This capability means that any \\nnetwork shares with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests \\ngroup, or the Everyone group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to \\nthe exposure or corruption of data. \\nImpact: \\nAll network users will need to authenticate before they can access shared resources.

It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria \\n(TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from \\noccurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this \\nrequirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system \\nexperiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down \\nif a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. \\nIf the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is \\nenabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be \\nsignificant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to \\nDo not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation \\nthreat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a \\ndenial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it \\nis overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the \\nSecurity log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable \\ndamage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS \\nfile system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it \\ncannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form \\nwhen the computer restarts. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. \\nRationale: \\nIf the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or \\nimportant troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security \\nincident.

To change the account, open System Tools, click \\nScheduled Tasks, and then click Accessories folder. Then click AT Service Account on \\nthe Advanced menu. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. \\nRationale: \\nIf you enable this policy setting, jobs that are created by server operators by means of \\nthe AT service will execute in the context of the account that runs that service.

If not, they will fail to \\nauthenticate once the above Require signing value is configured on the Domain \\nControllers. Fortunately, Negotiate signing is the default in the client configuration. \\nNote #2: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind \\n(ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No \\nMicrosoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP \\nsimple bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller. \\nNote #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients \\n(including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active \\nDirectory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those \\napplications. Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure \\nLDAP (LDAPS), or IPsec-protected connections. For more information on how to \\nidentify whether your DCs are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those \\naccesses are coming from), see this Microsoft TechNet blog article: Identifying Clear \\nText LDAP binds to your DC’s – Practical Windows Security \\nRationale: \\nUnsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an \\nintruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then \\nforwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could \\ncause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP \\ndirectory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization\\'s network, you can \\nimplement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, \\nyou could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode \\n(AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all \\ntypes of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult. \\nAdditionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be \\nreceived over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception \\nof account passwords by other systems on the network. \\n \\n \\nPage 152 \\nImpact: \\nUnless TLS/SSL is being used, the LDAP data signing option must be negotiated. \\nClients that do not support LDAP signing will be unable to run LDAP queries against the \\nDomain Controllers.

Alternatively, these clients must have a registry \\nchange. For information about this registry change, see Microsoft Knowledge Base \\narticle 325465: Windows 2000 domain controllers require SP3 or later when using \\nWindows Server 2003 administration tools.

Logon information for domain accounts can be cached \\nlocally to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted. This \\npolicy setting determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is \\ncached locally. If this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker \\nwho is able to access the file system of the server could locate this cached information \\nand use a brute force attack to determine user passwords. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s). \\nRationale: \\nThe number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose \\nlogon information the computer will cache locally. If the number is set to 4, then the \\ncomputer caches logon information for 4 users. When a 5th user logs on to the \\ncomputer, the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session. \\nUsers who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that \\ncomputer. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could \\nlocate this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user \\npasswords.

Configuring this setting to \\nForce Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to \\nthe benchmark. \\nRationale: \\nUsers sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, \\nallowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are \\nused for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is \\nremoved to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using \\nthose credentials. \\nImpact: \\nIf you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is \\nremoved, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still \\nmaintain a protected session. \\nIf you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is \\nremoved. \\nIf you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart \\ncard disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert \\nthe smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped \\ncomputer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function \\nidentically to Lock Workstation. \\nEnforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple \\ncomputers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. \\nFor example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log \\ninto several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network \\nenforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time.

For more information about these \\nsettings, see the \"Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications \\n(four related settings)\" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\nRationale: \\nSession hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network \\nas the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can \\npotentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and \\nforward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the \\nattacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain \\nunauthorized access to data. \\nSMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating \\nsystems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures \\nauthenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the \\nauthentication process, data transmission will not take place. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 187 \\nImpact: \\nThe Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server \\nunless that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing. \\nThe Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, \\nWindows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print \\nsharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking \\nattacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. \\nSMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, \\nwhich is then verified by both the client and the server. \\nImplementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each \\npacket needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is \\nperforming multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain \\nController, file server, print server, and application server performance may be \\nsubstantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned \\nSMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to \\nconnect.

LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user \\nsecurity features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the \\nKerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos \\nprotocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or \\nNTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 \\n(NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients \\nwhen they perform the following operations: \\n• \\nJoin a domain \\n• \\nAuthenticate between Active Directory forests \\n• \\nAuthenticate to down-level domains \\n• \\nAuthenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, \\nor Windows XP \\n• \\nAuthenticate to computers that are not in the domain \\nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which \\nchallenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice \\naffects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security \\nnegotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & \\nNTLM. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 234 \\nRationale: \\nWindows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and \\nNTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients \\nonly send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server \\n2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. \\nHowever, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - \\nwere sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that \\ntraffic to more easily reproduce the user\\'s password. \\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the \\nKerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server \\n2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM \\nprotocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication \\nprotocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the \\nlogon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. \\nEven if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and \\nservers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to \\nauthenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these \\nreasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as \\npossible. \\nImpact: \\nClients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server \\nsupports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 \\nauthentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to \\nauthenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed.

However, the kernel supports case \\nsensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for \\nUNIX (POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will \\nsupport case sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a \\nuser of the POSIX subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by \\nusing mixed case to label it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another \\nuser who uses typical Win32 tools, because only one of the files will be available. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\nRationale: \\nBecause Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case \\nsensitivity, failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that \\nsubsystem to create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of \\nupper and lower case letters.

An attack vector for these programs \\nwas to discover the password of the account named \"Administrator\" because that user \\naccount was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows \\nVista and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a \\ndefault installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the \\ncomputer are initially set up in one of two ways: \\n• \\nIf the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has \\nthe equivalent permissions as a local administrator. \\n• \\nIf the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are \\ncreated. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer \\nand create one if a local administrator account is warranted. \\nOnce Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, \\nbut we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled. \\nImpact: \\nThe built-in Administrator account uses Admin Approval Mode.

More information on this setting \\nis available at: MSKB 4034879: Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry entry to \\nmake LDAP authentication over SSL-TLS more secure \\nNote #2: In March 2020, Microsoft added a new GPO setting named Domain controller: \\nLDAP server channel binding token requirements which was bundled with that month’s \\nWindows security patches. This new “native” setting configures the exact same \\nLdapEnforceChannelBinding registry value and does not depend on an ADMX template. \\nTherefore it should be considered a “superseding” method of achieving the same \\nresults. However, since Extended Support ended on January 14, 2020 for Windows \\nServer 2008 (non-R2) and Windows Server 2008 R2, and they are no longer receiving \\nsecurity patches (unless hosted on Azure or under a paid support contract), they \\ntypically do not have the March 2020 (or later) patch readily available. If this is the case \\nin your environment, this ADMX-based setting should be used with those OSes instead \\nof the new native setting. \\nRationale: \\nRequiring Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) can prevent an attacker who is able to \\ncapture users\\' authentication credentials (e.g. OAuth tokens, session identifiers, etc.) \\nfrom reusing those credentials in another TLS session. This also helps to increase \\nprotection against \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks using LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS \\n(LDAPS). \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 426 \\nImpact: \\nAll LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). \\nThe LDAP server (Domain Controller) rejects authentication requests from clients that \\ndo not do so.

DNS over \\nHTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) \\nresolution over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).

Spoofing makes a \\ntransmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. \\nIt can also help prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because the session in-\\nbetween is encrypted. \\nImpact: \\nIf the option Enabled: Require DoH is chosen, this could limit 3rd party products from \\nlogging DNS traffic (in transit) as the traffic would be encrypted while in transit. The \\nRequire DoH option could also lead to domain-joined systems not functioning properly \\nwithin the environment. \\nThe option Enabled: Allow DoH will perform DoH queries if the configured DNS servers \\nsupport it. If they don´t support it, classic name resolution will be used.

LLMNR does not \\nrequire a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in \\nscenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\nRationale: \\nAn attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS \\n(UDP/137) broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows \\nthe location of the requested system. \\nNote: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting, \\nthe properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP \\n(on the WINS tab in the NIC properties).

IPv6 allows for \\nmany more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and \\noperating systems may not support IPv6 natively. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255) \\nRationale: \\nSince the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize \\nIPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 \\ncomponents removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic \\non. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not \\nneeded. \\nImpact: \\nConnectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that \\ndepends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use \\nIPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail. \\nThis registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How \\nto disable IPv6 or its components in Windows. \\nNote: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the Registry path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set \\nas prescribed. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 479 \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff \\n(255) (DWORD): \\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\TCPIP6\\\\Parameters:Disabl\\nedComponents \\nNote: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted. \\nNote #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this \\nregistry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is \\nprovided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration.

To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the \\nretention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. \\nThe consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the \\nlogs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate \\na large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These \\nrisks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log \\ndata. \\nIdeally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft \\nSystem Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. \\nSuch a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully \\ncompromises a server could clear the Security log.

If TLS is not \\nsupported, the connection fails. \\nNote: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections.

The opposite is true (and is consistent \\nwith the title of the setting). This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative \\nTemplate. \\nRationale: \\nAny feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network \\nconnections are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on \\ntrusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec. \\nImpact: \\nNew Remote Shell connections are not allowed and are rejected by the server. \\nNote: On Server 2012 (non-R2) and newer, due to design changes in the OS after \\nServer 2008 R2, configuring this setting as prescribed will prevent the ability to add or \\nremove Roles and Features (even locally) via the GUI.

The value for \\nthis policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand-\\nalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 \\npasswords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum \\npassword age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s). \\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \\nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \\ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nNote #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum \\nlimit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password \\nhistory (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs \\nRationale: \\nThe longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can \\ndetermine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have \\nbeen compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left \\nunchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if \\nusers continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good \\npassword policy is greatly reduced. \\nIf you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same \\nsmall number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum \\npassword age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can \\nreuse their original password. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 30 \\nImpact: \\nThe major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every \\ntime they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their \\npasswords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their \\npasswords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may \\ncreate passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, \\nand so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an \\nexcessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase \\nadministrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help \\ndesk to reset them frequently. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed. \\nRemediation: \\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 24 or \\nmore password(s): \\nComputer Configuration\\\\Policies\\\\Windows Settings\\\\Security Settings\\\\Account \\nPolicies\\\\Password Policy\\\\Enforce password history \\nDefault Value: \\n24 passwords remembered on domain members. 0 passwords remembered on stand-\\nalone servers. \\nReferences: \\n1. https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide/ \\nCIS Controls: \\nControls \\nVersion \\nControl \\nIG 1 IG 2 IG 3 \\nv8 \\n5.2 Use Unique Passwords \\n \\nUse unique passwords for all enterprise assets.

If you set the value to 0, the \\npassword will never expire. \\nBecause attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password \\nthe less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password.

Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that \\nusers are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because \\nthat allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the \\nvalid user has authorized access. \\nImpact: \\nIf the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their \\npasswords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, \\nbecause users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them.

There are many different theories about how to determine the best \\npassword length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \\n\"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and \\ncan include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a \\nvalid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string \\nof random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated \\nabout the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to \\npassword length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password \\nlength setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your \\norganization\\'s business requirements. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s). \\nNote: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the \\nLocal Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy \\nManagement Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. \\nHowever, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to \\na 20 character minimum password length. \\nNote #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can \\nuse tools to discover the accounts and passwords. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 36 \\nImpact: \\nRequirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an \\norganization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose \\nit. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account \\nlockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with \\nforgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your \\nusers about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger \\nnumber of character combinations, much harder to discover. \\nNote: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not \\nsupport passwords that are longer than 14 characters.

This fifth category can be regionally specific. \\nEach additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For \\ninstance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 \\n(approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per \\nsecond (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes \\nto crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 \\ncombinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without \\npunctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) \\npossible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 \\nattempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. \\nRemember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT \\ncharacters and other special keyboard characters such as \"!\" or \"@\". Proper use of the \\npassword settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 39 \\nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

However, custom exceptions to the default password \\npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \\ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \\nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \\nRationale: \\nPasswords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover \\nwith several publicly available tools. \\nImpact: \\nIf the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls \\nfor locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to \\npasswords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to \\ncomply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. \\nIf your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom \\nversion of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength \\nrules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row \\ncharacters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT \\nkey and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also \\nperform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain \\ncommon dictionary words or fragments. \\nAlso, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of \\na password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy \\nusers and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider \\na requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 \\nrange.

When a computer's time setting is \\nchanged, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events \\noccurred. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE. \\nNote: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain \\nControllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication \\nprotocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain \\nauthorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will \\noccur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not \\nsynchronized with the Domain Controllers. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 72 \\nRationale: \\nUsers who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For \\nexample, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on \\nfiles and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that \\nbelong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log \\non to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol \\nrequires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an \\nadministrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may \\ncause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. \\nThe risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member \\nServers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically \\nsynchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways: \\n• \\nAll client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain \\nController as their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nAll Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller \\n(PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nAll PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the \\nselection of their inbound time partner. \\n• \\nThe PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for \\nthe organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer \\nto synchronize with a reliable external time server. \\nThis vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the \\nsystem time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize \\nwith a time server that is not accurate. \\nImpact: \\nThere should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should \\nbe fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain.

A symbolic link is a \\npointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a \\nfile, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link.

No \\nMicrosoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP \\nsimple bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller. \\nNote #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients \\n(including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active \\nDirectory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those \\napplications. Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure \\nLDAP (LDAPS), or IPsec-protected connections.

In such attacks, an \\nintruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then \\nforwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could \\ncause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP \\ndirectory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can \\nimplement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, \\nyou could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode \\n(AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all \\ntypes of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult. \\nAdditionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be \\nreceived over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception \\nof account passwords by other systems on the network. \\n \\n \\nPage 152 \\nImpact: \\nUnless TLS/SSL is being used, the LDAP data signing option must be negotiated. \\nClients that do not support LDAP signing will be unable to run LDAP queries against the \\nDomain Controllers.

This \\npolicy setting determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is \\ncached locally. If this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker \\nwho is able to access the file system of the server could locate this cached information \\nand use a brute force attack to determine user passwords. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s). \\nRationale: \\nThe number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose \\nlogon information the computer will cache locally. If the number is set to 4, then the \\ncomputer caches logon information for 4 users. When a 5th user logs on to the \\ncomputer, the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session. \\nUsers who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that \\ncomputer.

Configuring this setting to \\nForce Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to \\nthe benchmark. \\nRationale: \\nUsers sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, \\nallowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are \\nused for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is \\nremoved to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using \\nthose credentials. \\nImpact: \\nIf you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is \\nremoved, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still \\nmaintain a protected session. \\nIf you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is \\nremoved. \\nIf you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart \\ncard disconnects the session without logging the users off.

If no signing request comes from the client, a \\nconnection will be allowed without a signature if the Microsoft network server: \\nDigitally sign communications (always) setting is not enabled. \\nNote: Enable this policy setting on SMB clients on your network to make them fully \\neffective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \\nRationale: \\nSession hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network \\nas the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can \\npotentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and \\nforward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the \\nattacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain \\nunauthorized access to data. \\nSMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating \\nsystems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures \\nauthenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the \\nauthentication process, data transmission will not take place. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 199 \\nImpact: \\nThe Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the \\nclient. That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be \\nnegotiated. \\nThe Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, \\nWindows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print \\nsharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking \\nattacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. \\nSMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, \\nwhich is then verified by both the client and the server. \\nImplementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each \\npacket needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is \\nperforming multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain \\nController, file server, print server, and application server performance may be \\nsubstantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned \\nSMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to \\nconnect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be \\nvulnerable to session hijacking attacks. \\nWhen SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows \\nServer 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server \\n2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves \\nthis issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy \\nsettings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 \\nor Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed.

LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user \\nsecurity features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the \\nKerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos \\nprotocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or \\nNTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 \\n(NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients \\nwhen they perform the following operations: \\n• \\nJoin a domain \\n• \\nAuthenticate between Active Directory forests \\n• \\nAuthenticate to down-level domains \\n• \\nAuthenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, \\nor Windows XP \\n• \\nAuthenticate to computers that are not in the domain \\nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which \\nchallenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice \\naffects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security \\nnegotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. \\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & \\nNTLM. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 234 \\nRationale: \\nWindows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and \\nNTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients \\nonly send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server \\n2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. \\nHowever, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - \\nwere sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that \\ntraffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. \\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the \\nKerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server \\n2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM \\nprotocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication \\nprotocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the \\nlogon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. \\nEven if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and \\nservers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to \\nauthenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these \\nreasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as \\npossible. \\nImpact: \\nClients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server \\nsupports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 \\nauthentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to \\nauthenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM. \\nAudit: \\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \\nprescribed.

More information on this setting \\nis available at: MSKB 4034879: Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry entry to \\nmake LDAP authentication over SSL-TLS more secure \\nNote #2: In March 2020, Microsoft added a new GPO setting named Domain controller: \\nLDAP server channel binding token requirements which was bundled with that month’s \\nWindows security patches. This new “native” setting configures the exact same \\nLdapEnforceChannelBinding registry value and does not depend on an ADMX template. \\nTherefore it should be considered a “superseding” method of achieving the same \\nresults. However, since Extended Support ended on January 14, 2020 for Windows \\nServer 2008 (non-R2) and Windows Server 2008 R2, and they are no longer receiving \\nsecurity patches (unless hosted on Azure or under a paid support contract), they \\ntypically do not have the March 2020 (or later) patch readily available. If this is the case \\nin your environment, this ADMX-based setting should be used with those OSes instead \\nof the new native setting. \\nRationale: \\nRequiring Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) can prevent an attacker who is able to \\ncapture users\\' authentication credentials (e.g. OAuth tokens, session identifiers, etc.) \\nfrom reusing those credentials in another TLS session. This also helps to increase \\nprotection against \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks using LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS \\n(LDAPS). \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 426 \\nImpact: \\nAll LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). \\nThe LDAP server (Domain Controller) rejects authentication requests from clients that \\ndo not do so.

Spoofing makes a \\ntransmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. \\nIt can also help prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because the session in-\\nbetween is encrypted. \\nImpact: \\nIf the option Enabled: Require DoH is chosen, this could limit 3rd party products from \\nlogging DNS traffic (in transit) as the traffic would be encrypted while in transit. The \\nRequire DoH option could also lead to domain-joined systems not functioning properly \\nwithin the environment. \\nThe option Enabled: Allow DoH will perform DoH queries if the configured DNS servers \\nsupport it. If they don´t support it, classic name resolution will be used.
